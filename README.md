# Evinced EvCore Interview

Welcome! This is a small boilerplate starter to help you write JS code and run it in a browser. Although you can use a different environment and toolchain, we recommend to use this one. Follow the steps below to make sure everything is working ahead of time:

## Setup

1. Clone this repo to your machine: `git clone https://github.com/GetEvinced/evCore-interview`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`. It will launch Webpack (in watch mode) and a simple server to access your code and a simple web page we prepared for you
4. Open the "Hello world" page in your browser: [http://localhost:9000/src/index.html](http://localhost:9000/src/index.html)

<sup>
Although it should work with any modern Node/NPM version, we only tested it on Node v16.15 and NPM v8.11
</sup>

## Code

1. Open `src/index.ts` and make a change
2. Refresh the webpage in your browser and make sure you see your change

Feel free to make any changes you want: install new dependencies, split your code into modules, or add Prettier with tabs instead of spaces if that's your cup of tea!

See you in the interview ðŸ˜Ž
